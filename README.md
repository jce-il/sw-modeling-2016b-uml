## Homework2 UML/OCL

Modeling an online store (Amazon like), through:

1. Usecase analysis, with: 
  - [Actors and stakeholder table](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/wiki/Actor-Stakeholder-Table)
  - One [use-case diagram](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/edit/master/OnlineStoreDiagram%20(1)%20(1)%20(3).xml)
  - One detailed written [use case](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/wiki/Written-Use-Case:-Explore-Catalogue)
1. Four diagrams: [Sequence](), [Class](), [Activity](), [Component]()|[Deployment]()
1. [OCL]: One diagram with constrains (see CAR example in lecture slides)

The models should be simple but not too simplistic! Using some non trivial UML constructs.
