## Homework2 UML/OCL

Modeling an online store (Amazon like), through:

1. Usecase analysis, with: 
  - [Actors and stakeholder table](./ActorsTable.md)
  - One [use-case diagram](./uc-diagram.md)
  - One detailed written [use case](./use-case.md)
1. Four diagrams: [Sequence](./Sequence.md), [Class](./Class.md), [Activity](./Activity.md), [Deployment](./Deployment.md)
1. [OCL]: One diagram with constrains (see CAR example in lecture slides)

The models should be simple but not too simplistic! Using some non trivial UML constructs.
