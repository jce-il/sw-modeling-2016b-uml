## Homework2 UML/OCL

Modeling an online store (Amazon like), through:

1. Usecase analysis, with: 
  - [Actors and stakeholder table](./ActorsTable.md)
  -  [use-case diagram](./uc-diagram.md)
  -  [use case](./use-case.md)
2. [Sequence](./Sequence.md), [Class](./Class.md), [Activity](./Activity.md), [Deployment](./Deployment.md)
3. [OCL](./ocl.md)

The models should be simple but not too simplistic! Using some non trivial UML constructs.
