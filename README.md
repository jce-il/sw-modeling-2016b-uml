## Homework2 UML/OCL

Modeling an online store (Amazon like), through:

1. Usecase analysis, with: 
  - Actors and Stakeholder table
    [Actors and stakeholder table](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/wiki/Actor-Stakeholder-Table)
  - Use case diagram 
    ![use-case diagram](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/blob/master/OnlineStoreDiagram%20(1)%20(1)%20(3).png)
  - One detailed written use case: 
    [use case](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/wiki/Written-Use-Case:-Explore-Catalogue)
1. Four diagrams: 
  - Sequence diagram (High Level e-store)
   ![Sequence](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/blob/master/SequenceDiagramPurchaseItemFinalVersion%20(1).png), 
 

    This sequence diagram presents the purchase of an item in the e-store on a high level point of view. 
     The flow can be describe as follow;
        The user opens the website, searches an item, and eventually view the item description.
        He then adds the item to cart.
        If it is the first item he wants to order he creates an order, otherwise he adds the item to the existing cart.
        Those steps are repeated till the customer is done. He then checks out and get the cart information.
        The last step is the payment information, the payment making and the number order and confirmation after authorization.
      The sequence diagram shows us how the processes operate with one another and in what order. We can see the object interactions        arranged in time sequence.The lifelines show the different processes and objects that live simultaneously                             (Display, Controller, Inventory, Order, Cart) and the horizontal arrows show the message exchanged between them, in the order in       which they occur. The processes we have (at a high level) are the following:
    
    *Display: the data that appears on screen after interaction 
    
    *Controller: process generated by the display process whenever an interaction with the server is needed.
    
    *Inventory: stands for the list of products and their details
    
    *Order: stands for the ordering process
    
    *Cart: stands for the cart information of the purchase.
   
   
  - Class diagram (high level e-store for Purchase Item)
   ![Class](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/blob/master/ClassDiagramPurchaseItem.png),

         This class diagram is a static diagram that shows us the structure of the system by showing the classes, their attributes,         operations and the relationships among the objects.
    We can notice aggregation relationship between Cart and Product, as a the Cart class has a list of products, between Order and        PaymentInformation as an Order has an instance of PaymentInformation and between Order and Cart as an Order has an instance of        Cart. The other relationships are associations representing the static relationship shared among the objects of the classes.

  - Activity diagram 
   ![Activity](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/blob/master/ActivityDiagram.png), 

    This activity diagram focuses on the login/registration activity. 
    We can follow the workflow of stepwise activities and actions, with support for choice, iteration and concurrency.
    Each step covers all the possibilities and leads us to a final situation where the process stops.

   - Component diagram (e-store)
     ![Component](https://github.com/rivkage/sw-modeling-2016b-uml/blob/master/eStoreComponentDiagram.png)

     This component diagram depict how components are wired together to form larger components and the e-store software system.
     We separate the system in entities and show the relation with interfaces and ports.

1. [OCL]: One diagram with constrains (see CAR example in lecture slides)

The models should be simple but not too simplistic! Using some non trivial UML constructs.
